# R Regression Analysis Project

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates linear and multiple linear regression analysis using R‚Äôs built-in datasets: `mtcars` and `iris`.  
We apply statistical modeling to explore relationships between variables and generate plots to visualize the fits.

---

## ‚ö° Approach
- Built a regression model to predict **mpg** from **wt** (weight) and **hp** (horsepower) in the `mtcars` dataset.
- Built a regression model to predict **Sepal.Length** from **Petal.Length** and **Petal.Width** in the `iris` dataset.
- Used `lm()` for modeling and generated plots to visualize regression lines.
- Saved plots as image files for reference.

## ‚ñ∂ How to Run
1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure R is installed and Rscript is in your system PATH.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Open terminal and run:
```bash
Rscript "path/to/regression_analysis.R"
```
